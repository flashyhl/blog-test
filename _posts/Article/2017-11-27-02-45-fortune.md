"Having to apply and try out for something forces kids to take the time to think about and make decisions on what they feel is worth their time and effort. It winds up being a great foreshadower and introduction of the reality of dealing with the competitiveness of life...The focus, practice, and determination that this process requires are preparation for life's challenges and teach lessons on facing disappointment during the times when someone does not make the team."
