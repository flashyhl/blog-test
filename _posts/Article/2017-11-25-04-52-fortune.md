Those who believe that they believe in God, but without passion in their
hearts, without anguish in mind, without uncertainty, without doubt,
without an element of despair even in their consolation, believe only in
the God idea, not God Himself.
        ― Miguel de Unamuno, Spanish philosopher and writer
