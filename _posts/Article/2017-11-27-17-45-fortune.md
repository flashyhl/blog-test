These patriots don't mince words... Okay, sure, they ARE dangerous,
hopelessly ignorant, inbred, retarded borderline lunatics with an
insatiable lust for the blood of sinners ― but at least they're HONEST
about it.
        ― Reverend Ivan Stang, cofounder of the Church of the Subgenius,
           about a group known as Free Love Ministries, in his book _High
           Weirdness By Mail_
